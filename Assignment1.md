#Aims
The aim of this study is to examine the similarities and differences in 2 software implementations of the Ethnocentrism model first described by Ross Axelrod and Ross Hammond ([Axelrod & Hammond, 2003](2003)). The first model examined is a NetLogo implementation that comes standard as part of the NetLogo package, the second is our own implementation, written in Java and is an attempt to replicate the first NetLogo model. The 2 implementations are examined statistically. This is to try and discern if they can be determined to be similar via a standard statistical t-test. The outputs are also examined as line graphs of multiple runs to possibly find any trends or patterns that may not have emerged as a results of the t tests.

#Background
Ethnocentrism is a set of attitudes and behaviours that exists almost to the point of ubiquitousness in our world. Within this set, is the cooperation of members of the same type and non cooperation (or defection from) members of another type. The model devised by Axelrod and Hammond [Axelrod & Hammond, 2003](2003) shows emergent ethnocentric behaviour can present itself from a simple evolutionary of local competition between individuals. The model is an agent-based cellular-automaton that treats interactions as one-move Prisoner's Dilemmas [Rapoport & Chammah,1970](Rapoport & Chammah, 1970)
